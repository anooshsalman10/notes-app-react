## 📝 React Notes App

A simple and intuitive **Notes application built with React** that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes with **persistent storage using browser localStorage**.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of **React state management, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`), and real-world CRUD functionality**.
